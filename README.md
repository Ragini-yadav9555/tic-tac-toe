This is a simple and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game allows two players to compete in the classic Tic-Tac-Toe format on the same device. It provides an easy-to-use interface where players can take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the game board.

The game includes the following features:
- A **responsive design** that works across different screen sizes.
- Automatic detection of a **winner** or a **draw** after each move.
- A simple and clean **user interface** that makes the game easy to play.

The game is built entirely with **front-end technologies**:
- **HTML** is used to create the structure and layout of the game board.
- **CSS** is used to style the board, cells, and overall layout, providing a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript** is used to implement the game logic, handle user interactions, and track the game state.

This project is a great starting point for those who want to understand how to build interactive web applications using basic web technologies.
